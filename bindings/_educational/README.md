# Educational Demonstrations

This directory contains **educational demonstrations** of proven safety concepts, not production-ready specifications.

## Purpose

These files illustrate how safety primitives translate to platforms that:
- Have no real-world production use
- Exist primarily for teaching/learning
- Lack hardware safety features
- Serve as conceptual illustrations

## Contents

| Directory | Platform | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `hack/` | Nand2Tetris Hack Assembly | Shows safety at bare-metal level for CS education |

## Disclaimer

These are **illustrative examples** for understanding concepts at different abstraction levels. They are not intended for:
- Production use
- Benchmarking
- Performance-critical applications
- Real system development

For production-ready bindings, see the main `bindings/` directory.
