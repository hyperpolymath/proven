future:
  formal-verification:
    - "Eliminate all believe_me instances with actual Idris2 proofs"
    - "Eliminate all assert_total with well-founded recursion"
    - "Complete all proof holes (?prop_name_rhs)"
    - "Add ECHIDNA consensus verification to CI"
  ffi-bridge:
    - "Compile Idris2 to RefC and link with Zig FFI bridge"
    - "Make FFI bidirectional (callbacks from foreign code)"
    - "Add hardware crypto acceleration support (AES-NI, SHA extensions)"
  bindings:
    - "Convert all 63 bindings from reimplementation to FFI delegation"
    - "Create 26 missing bindings"
    - "Resubmit to opam, crates.io, PyPI with 0 security findings"
  applications:
    - "Build barebones crashproof servers (httpd, dns, smtp, mqtt, etc.)"
    - "Build proven-cli for common safe operations"
    - "Build proven-wasm for browser usage"
  abi:
    - "Define bidirectional ABI in Idris2 with dependent type proofs"
