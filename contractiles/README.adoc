= Contractiles - proven library
:toc:
:sectnums:

This directory contains the contractiles for the **proven** formally verified safety library. These files define the operational, validation, trust, recovery, and intent framework that governs the repository.

== Structure

* `must/Mustfile` - Required invariants and validation checks. These MUST pass before any merge or release.
* `trust/Trustfile` - Cryptographic verification steps. Points to the authoritative `Trustfile.a2ml` at the repository root.
* `dust/Dustfile` - Rollback and recovery semantics. Defines what happens when invariants break.
* `lust/Intentfile` - Future intent and roadmap direction. Where proven is headed.
* `k9/` - K9 configuration templates (Nickel-based operational configs).

== Relationship to Proven Architecture

The contractiles enforce the core architectural invariant of proven:

1. **All computation happens in Idris 2** (formally verified, total, dependently typed).
2. **Zig FFI bridge** exposes Idris to the C ABI.
3. **Language bindings** are thin wrappers that call through the FFI -- they MUST NOT reimplement logic.

The Mustfile checks enforce these invariants. The Dustfile defines recovery when they break. The Trustfile ensures cryptographic integrity of the supply chain.

== Usage

These files are consumed by:

* **robot-repo-automaton** - Automated CI/CD enforcement
* **hypatia** - Neurosymbolic security scanning
* **just** recipes - Local developer checks (`just contractile-check`)

== See Also

* `Trustfile.a2ml` (repository root) - The authoritative trust document
* `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` - Current project state
* `.machine_readable/META.scm` - Architecture decisions (especially ADR-008, ADR-009)
