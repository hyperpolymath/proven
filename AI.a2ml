## Repository Focus
- `proven` is a formally verified safety library: 104 Idris2 modules with dependent type proofs, Zig FFI bridge, 89 language binding targets.
- Treated as a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- License: PMPL-1.0-or-later. Copyright: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (hyperpolymath).
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Architecture (CRITICAL)
- ALL computation happens in Idris2 (`src/Proven/`). Bindings MUST NOT reimplement logic.
- Zig FFI bridge (`ffi/zig/`) is a pure ABI layer with no safety logic.
- Language bindings (`bindings/`) are thin wrappers that call Idris via FFI only.
- See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for detailed constraints and common mistakes.

## Workflow
1. Inspect `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machine_readable/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Current State (v1.1.0)
- 104 core Idris2 modules with dependent types and totality checking
- 14 FFI exports in Zig bridge layer
- ~283 `believe_me` instances across 38 files (FFI stubs and axiomatised lemmas)
- 18 language bindings complete, 71 remaining targets scaffolded

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
