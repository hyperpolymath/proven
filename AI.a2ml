## Repository Focus
- `proven` is a formally verified safety library: 104 Idris2 core modules (258 total .idr files) with dependent type proofs, Zig FFI bridge (65 exports), 120+ language binding targets (18 complete, 102 scaffolded).
- Treated as a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- License: PMPL-1.0-or-later. Copyright: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (hyperpolymath).
- Read `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml` FIRST for canonical locations and invariants.

## Architecture (CRITICAL)
- ALL computation happens in Idris2 (`src/Proven/`). Bindings MUST NOT reimplement logic.
- Zig FFI bridge (`ffi/zig/`) is a pure ABI layer with no safety logic.
- Language bindings (`bindings/`) are thin wrappers that call Idris via FFI only.
- See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for detailed constraints and common mistakes.

## Workflow
1. Read `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml` first for session startup protocol.
2. Inspect `.machine_readable/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
3. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machine_readable/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
4. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Current State (v1.2.0, 2026-02-22)
- 104 core Idris2 modules with dependent types and totality checking
- 65 FFI exports in Zig bridge layer
- **believe_me = 0** (eliminated from ~4,566 instances)
- **assert_total = 0** (all eliminated)
- 18 language bindings complete, 102 scaffolded
- Overall project ~55% complete (core solid, ecosystem incomplete)
- Apps: 1/13 (proven-bgp only), GPU/crypto: 0%, convenience modules: 0%

## Security
- `Trustfile.a2ml` defines the security specification: threat model, policies, integrity hashes, Lean4 proof references.
- `.github/workflows/trustfile.yml` enforces Trustfile policies in CI.
- All changes must comply with architecture invariants defined in the Trustfile.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, `.bot_directives/`, or `Trustfile.a2ml` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
